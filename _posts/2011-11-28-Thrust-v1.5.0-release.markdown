## {{ page.title }} ##

Thrust v1.5.0 provides introduces new programmer productivity and performance
enhancements. New functionality for creating anonymous "lambda" functions has
been added. A faster host sort provides 2-10x faster performance for sorting
arithmetic types on (single-threaded) CPUs. A new OpenMP sort provides 2.5x-3.0x
speedup over the host sort using a quad-core CPU. When sorting arithmetic types
with the OpenMP backend the combined performance improvement is 5.9x for 32-bit
integers and ranges from 3.0x (64-bit types) to 14.2x (8-bit types). A new CUDA
reduce_by_key implementation provides 2-3x faster performance.

The CHANGELOG details the complete list of changes since v1.4.
