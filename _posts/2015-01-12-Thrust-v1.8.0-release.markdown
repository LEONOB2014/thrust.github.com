## {{ page.title }} ##

We are pleased to announce the release of [Thrust] [1] v1.8, an open-source C++ library for
developing high-performance parallel applications. Modeled after the C++ Standard Template
Library, Thrust brings a familiar abstraction layer to the realm of parallel computing

Thrust 1.8.0 introduces support for algorithm invocation from CUDA `__device__` code, support
for CUDA streams, and algorithm performance improvements. Users may now invoke Thrust algorithms
from CUDA `__device__` code, providing a parallel algorithms library to CUDA programmers
authoring custom kernels, as well as allowing Thrust programmers to nest their algorithm calls
within functors. The `thrust::seq` execution policy allows users to require sequential algorithm
execution in the calling thread and makes a sequential algorithms library available to individual
CUDA threads. The `.on(stream)` syntax allows users to request a CUDA stream for kernels launched
during algorithm execution. Finally, new CUDA algorithm implementations provide substantial
performance improvements.

Refer to the [CHANGELOG] [2] for a complete list of improvements since v1.7.

Get started with Thrust today! First [download Thrust v1.8] [3] and then follow the online
[quick-start guide] [4]. Refer to the [online documentation] [5] for a complete list of features.
Many [concrete example] [6] programs and a set of [introductory slides] [7] are also available.
