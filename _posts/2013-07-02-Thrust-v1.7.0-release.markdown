## {{ page.title }} ##

We are pleased to announce the release of [Thrust] [1] v1.7, an open-source C++ library for
developing high-performance parallel applications. Modeled after the C++ Standard Template
Library, Thrust brings a familiar abstraction layer to the realm of parallel computing

Thrust 1.7.0 introduces a new interface for controlling algorithm execution as
well as several new algorithms and performance improvements. With this new
interface, users may directly control how algorithms execute as well as details
such as the allocation of temporary storage. Key/value versions of thrust::merge
and the set operation algorithms have been added, as well stencil versions of
partitioning algorithms. For 32b types, new CUDA merge and set operations provide 2-15x faster
performance while a new CUDA comparison sort provides 1.3-4x faster performance.

Get started with Thrust today! First [download Thrust v1.7] [2] and then follow the online
[quick-start guide] [3]. Refer to the [online documentation] [4] for a complete list of features.
Many [concrete example] [5] programs and a set of [introductory slides] [6] are also available.
